# QRatitude front end
This is the front end for the QRatitude inventory management system
built by Freeside Atlanta.

## Purpose
To offer a friendly, responsive interface to the node.js/restify powered
backend, and to establish a boilerplate for future instances.

## Setup
The following packages are needed to work on the front.

```
$ yum install -y ruby ruby-devel rubygems
$ gem install sass compass zen-grids
```

## Theme
Be sure to read `/themes/default/README` to familiarize yourself
with coding conventions for styles.
