The styles are organized according to SMACSS (http://www.smacss.com/)
and are defined with Sass v3.2.9 SCSS syntax. (http://www.sass-lang.com)

Know both before touching anything. Neither are complicated.

You will gain much productivity in this system, but only
if you do things in a certain way.

SASS SETUP
===============
$ (apt-get|yum) install ruby ruby-devel rubygems
$ gem install sass

./COMPILE
===============
There is a script in the style directory that compiles
the site style information to CSS either in discrete
bursts or in real time.

Run it without options for usage details.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND LOADING CONVENTIONS
===========================================

"style.scss" combines all styles in the entire system,
and it imports "index files" from top level SMACSS directories
(hence-forth "top level directories" or TLDs)

    /<theme root>
        style.scss
        layout/
            _index.scss
        module/
            _index.scss
        state/
            _index.scss
        theme/
            _index.scss
        base/
            _index.scss

Each index file itself imports all styles inside
the directory it resides in, as well as all
index files in IMMEDIATE subdirectories. style.scss is
ONLY aware of index files in TLDs. So, it is the responsibility
of index files in TLDs to include index files in subdiectories.

No index file should include any specific style
sheets in subdirectories outside of the index file.
Index files must only import specific styles
from the directory it immediately resides in.

No index file is to import any sheet more than two directories
deep from it's current location.

Example:

    /<theme root>
        style.scss <- imports 'module/index'
        module/
            _a.scss
            _b.scss
            _index.scss <- imports 'a', 'b', 's/index' and 't/index'
            s/
                _x.scss
                _y.scss
                _index.scss <- imports 'x', 'y' and 'deeper/index'
                deeper/
                    _index.scss <- imports 'u' and 'v'
                    _u.scss
                    _v.scss
            t/
                _index.scss <- imports 'g' and 'h'
                _g.scss
                _h.scss


For reasons why underscores prefix file names, see Conventions.

CONVENTIONS
===============

- Do not change or add to the TLD structure.
  Subdirectories of TLDs are permissible, but must
  be justified.

- The output style sheet of the entire system is named "styles.css" and
  will be compressed. No comments are to appear in it, and it will
  have UNIX line endings. The compile script handles this for you.

- Variable names are descriptive, and in camelCase.

- Variables that represent common properties
  must have those properties as the first words.

  Ex. 
    $widthSidebar;
    $widthImage;
    $widthSpan;

    $heightFooter;
    $heightNavbar;

    $fontSizeLarge;
    $fontSizeMid;

    etc. 

- Tabs are 4 spaces

- Allman indentation

- Comply with SMACSS

- Make a new file in the appropriate location when a new set
  of styles pertaining to a particular module or concept is
  needed. So, if you are making a new module, make a new file
  just for it in "modules/". Grouped collections of modules may
  need a subdirectory.

- Start all file names with an underscore and give it the .scss extension.
  Only "styles.scss" may break this convention.
  This configuration prevents more than one CSS file from being output
  in compilation. See "Partials" in Sass reference for more information.

- @import all files in any directory inside the "_index.scss" file in that
  ssme directory. Order the imports according to CSS declarations.
  But if you are really good with CSS, order should not matter.
  Always @import "_index.scss" in subdirectories in the immediate parent
  directory's "_index.scss"
